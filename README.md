# everybody-code-2025

This workspace contains solution code and working files used to solve the Everybody Codes 2025 quests. Another opportunity to torture myself with Golang

Purpose
- This repository is a personal workspace to track code/solutions that solve the Everybody Codes 2025 quests: https://everybody.codes/event/2025/quests
- It is not an official distribution of the event; it's for learning and tracking solutions.

Repository structure (example)
- `quest-3-sum-of-set.go` — example solution file (already in this workspace)
- Add one file per quest (e.g. `quest-<n>-<short-name>.go`)

How to run
- Install Go (1.20+ recommended).
- From the repository root you can run a specific solution file, for example (PowerShell):

```
go run .\everybody-code-2025\quest-3-sum-of-set.go
```
